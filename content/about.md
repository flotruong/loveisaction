      <p class="mt3">These are trying times. It seems all too easy to descend into cynicism about the state of our nation, our politics, and the world. But while there be many things that we’d like to change (and let’s face it, that’s always true), the point is that we all have the power, the agency, and the ability to improve the world around us. That will take different forms, and Love is Action is meant as a reminder of just how varied those forms really are.
      </br>
      </br>
      Love is Action is a campaign built around the potential of the individual. We hope that our installation and designs will resonate with others and we freely offer them for use. There is plenty that one person can do, but there’s real power in what we can do collectively. To that end, we hope to remind people of their own agency, provide them with a variety of resources to help them find the cause that resonates with them, and give them designs that will help them spread the word. Love is Action is not about dictating what someone should do, it’s about helping them determine that for themselves.
      </br>
      </br>
      So what should you do? That’s for you to figure out. But we hope that we can help. Let’s make sure that the days ahead are even better than those past for all of us.
      </br>
      </br>
      With love,
      </br>
      The Love is Action Team</p>
